Bachelor in Computer Science - Senior Project 

This project was submitted by myself and 2 teammates as our senior project to graduate CS at NDU in 2022.

At the core of the project is a zombie shooting game that involves some external functionalities such as:
- Authentication
- Score tracking
- Leaderboard

The game is accompanied by a website which provides these external functionalities.

Both interfaces share a same backend that accesses the database.
